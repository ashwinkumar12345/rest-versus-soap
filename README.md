# Comparing REST and SOAP Web Services

To fully understand the difference between REST and SOAP, it is important to understand what an API is and how it works, how to use HTTP and perform REST and SOAP operations.

> ## API Overview

API is an acronym that stands for application programming interface.
 - Application (A) is a piece of software code that performs a task
 - Program (P) executes the task within the application
 - Interface (I) is a place where you can tell the program to run within that application

Simple APIs

A simple API is where you can access the interface of the application using a browser or mobile app. 

For example, the Google homepage is an interface through which you can tell the Google application to run a program to perform a search and provide you back with a web page of the results.

Complex APIs

A complex API is where you have to access the interface at the server location to run the program.  

For example, to use the Google Translation API you have to access the interface on the Google translation server and run the translation program on that server.

In general, the term API refers to Complex APIs.

Accessing the interface where the software is located is cost efficient for the software vendor because they do not have to build a web or mobile app for you to interact with that software.

You also have the flexibility to interface with that software using any method you choose.

> ## Understanding APIs

An API transaction workflow is as follows:

 - A request is made for a task to be performed
 - A program is run to complete that request
 - The program sends back a response with the results
 
 If the API request and response are sent over the internet, then the API is called a “Web Service API.”

- Used to transfer money and store data
- Anyone can download an Ethereum client and run a node
- Each node has a complete copy of the blockchain

> ## Understanding HTTP

The request and response are transferred over the internet using a protocol called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). The HTTP protocol has four parts for request and response:

- Go to Chrome Webstore and install the Metmask plugin
- Create a username and password
- Copy your 12-word mnemonic

- Main (productions apps and where ether has value)
- Ropsten
- Kovan
- Rinkeby
- localhost
- Custom RPC

> ## REST versus SOAP

- Your account consists of your account address, your public key, and your private key
- Account address is similar to your email address
- Public and private keys together form your password
- These are hex numbers, once converted to base10 => 8 x 10^79 (incomprehensibly large, cannot be guessed)
