> ## API Overview
- API is an acronym that stands for application programming interface.
  - Application (A) is a piece of software code that performs a task
  - Program (P) executes the task within the application
  - Interface (I) is a place where you can tell the program to run within that application

Simple APIs

A simple API is where you can access the interface of the application using a browser or mobile app. 

For example, the Google homepage is an interface through which you can tell the Google application to run a program to perform a search and provide you back with a web page of the results.

Complex APIs

A complex API is where you have to access the interface at the server location to run the program.  

For example, to use the Google Translation API you have to access the interface on the Google translation server and run the translation program on that server.

In general, the term API refers to Complex APIs.

Accessing the interface where the software is located is cost efficient for the software vendor because they do not have to build a web or mobile app for you to interact with that software.

You also have the flexibility to interface with that software using any method you choose.

- Used to transfer money and store data
- Anyone can download an Ethereum client and run a node
- Each node has a complete copy of the blockchain

- For Developers: web3.js
- For Consumers: Metamask (chrome extension) or Mist Browser

> ## Understanding SOAP

- Go to Chrome Webstore and install the Metmask plugin
- Create a username and password
- Copy your 12-word mnemonic

> ## Understanding REST

- Main (productions apps and where ether has value)
- Ropsten
- Kovan
- Rinkeby
- localhost
- Custom RPC

> ## REST versus SOAP

- Your account consists of your account address, your public key, and your private key
- Account address is similar to your email address
- Public and private keys together form your password
- These are hex numbers, once converted to base10 => 8 x 10^79 (incomprehensibly large, cannot be guessed)
